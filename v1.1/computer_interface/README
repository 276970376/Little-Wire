You can find experimental C++ and C# libraries from https://github.com/kehribar/Little-Wire/tree/master/v1.1/computer_interface

When they are stable enough, i will pull them to the main branch.

Hi!

Since maintaining different languages at the same time is a very demanding task, I only updated the C library for the V1.1 firmware. I saw that most people use C to interface with the Little Wire. 

Please get in contact if you want me to update the other libraries.
