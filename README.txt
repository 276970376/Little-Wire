========================================
= Short story  
========================================
- When i saw simpleavr's implementation of usbtiny on attiny45 , i thought it would be cool if i make a kit version of this with a minimal form factor. Then i designed a PCB and sent for first prototype. Later on i thought, if i want to sell this, it would be much cooler ,and more suitable with "Open Source Hardware" concept, if i bring this project one step ahead. So i tried to fit anything extra to the device and this project came out.

========================================
= What is this?
========================================
- usbtiny compatable AVR programmer  
- 4 channel digital input / output  
- 1 channel ADC with 10 bit resolution  
- 2 paralel hardware PWM outputs  
- SPI interface   

========================================
= Possible usages
========================================
- AVR programming */summon captainObvious*  
- LED dimming , color mixing  
- General servo driving   
- Pan and tilt servo control of a webcam for face tracking  
- With additional motor driver IC, 2 wheel motor driving   
- Analog voltage recording and plotting  

========================================
= What is included?
========================================
- Eagle schematic / layout files. Also in PNG and PDF formats  
- Microcontroller firmware files and makefile  
- C# class for Windows USB interface
