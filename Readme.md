# Little Wire - v1.2

Little Wire is multi-featured USB controlled open source hardware tool packed in a minimal form factor designed by ihsan Kehribar. This documentation explains the features of the Little Wire via computer inteface library written in C language. Details of the library can be found in the `littleWire.h` header file.

There are also official C++, C# and Processing libraries for interfacing with the current or previous firmware versions of the Little Wire. At some level, maintaining more than one language become a problem; therefore currently the C language library will be the only official and supported interface library. On the other hand there is a good supported Ruby library exists for some features of the Little Wire. Users can take a look at it.
